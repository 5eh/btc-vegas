### About the hack

<details>
  <summary>INTRO</summary>
  Fund The World bridges the gap between Bitcoin holders and global charitable impact. Our platform allows users to chat with an AI assistant that helps them discover charity organizations accepting Bitcoin donations that align with their values and interests.

By simply conversing with our AI, users can explore causes they care about, learn about vetted organizations working in those areas, and make seamless Bitcoin donations—all in one intuitive experience. Whether you're passionate about environmental conservation, education, humanitarian aid, or countless other causes, Fund The World helps you direct your digital assets toward meaningful change.
Join us in revolutionizing charitable giving through cryptocurrency and making global impact just a conversation away.

Our hackathon submission includes a nicely designed website, dynamic database functionality, and interactive AI integration inside of Bitcoin's ecosystem, with the ability to send charity donations on the Bitcoin blockchain.

<summary>PROBLEM</summary>
One of the major problems that charities face is the need for constant funding, the problems are:
1. Inability to find a worthy cause to donate to.
2. Lack of transparency or reputable gaining mechanisms that help verify the charity's authenticity.
3. The friction of currency conversion and dealing with financial institutions to facilitate transactions across vast distances.
</details>

<details>
<summary>SOLUTION</summary>
The solutions that we came up with to solve these problems:
1. Implementing the ability for users to donate to verified charities on the public Bitcoin blockchain.
2. Harnessing the power of the Gemini API to help aid users in finding the right charity/cause to donate.
</details>

<details>
<summary>BLOCKCHAIN INTEGRATION</summary>
1. Users are able to access the charity's public Bitcoin address once view from "All Organizations" and clicking on the charity of their choice.
2. QR codes can be generated from the AI chatbox on the landing page by chatting with the agent. The codes are generated to send a specific amount, and can be recurring transactions (daily, weekly, monthly, annually).
</details>

<!-- <details>
<summary>CODE PROBLEMS</summary>
1. As a demo/tester you will likely get several Hydration UI errors. We have found that once you handle the essential operations (Creating the raffle, donating to a raffle, or announcing a winner), it is useful to head back to the home index and then change the wallet from there to the permissioned account before then accessing another section of the site.
2. Some information may be static, but it is easy to implement and read the RPC indexing information from the public Solana API (Read: https://solana.com/docs/rpc).
3. On live production, very rarely do some users not get selected, but if this happens, it is in your best ethical and legal interest to retrieve the arrayed list from the program and then use a transparent means of announcing the winner.
4. The treasury is currently enabled to retrieve all funds without announcing a winner, on live production - users should be aware of this issue and only consent to verified and audited program deployments.
